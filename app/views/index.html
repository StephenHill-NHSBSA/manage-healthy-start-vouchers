                <li>Added the ability for a CCS agent to add an applicant who is <strong>16 - 17 and Pregnant</strong>
                  (<a
                    href="https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/BU7KhYJmVpFvobEHV3NaoCcQUEiHZF8HjaUnSsuoi5hgSPHlQRzyAfMeGTqpPF4O"
                    target="_blank">view user flow</a>).
                </li>
                <li>Amended the prototype to correctly demonstrate the NHS BSA's chosen login method (Azure AD).</li>
                <li>Based off initial CCS feedback, we amended the 'Add Applicant' journey so that the questions aren't
                  asked from a third-party perspective e.g. 'What's their date of birth?', instead they are asked as if
                  CCS were reading them to the applicant e.g. What's your date of birth?. This reduces the cognitive
                  load on a CCS agent and is more of a natural conversation.</li>
                <li>Again based off initial CCS feedback, we also added in a unique reference number on the confirmation
                  page. Third party research suggests that not only does it help CCS staff find an application, but it
                  also reassures the applicant that their application is being dealt with and helps to reduce the number
                  calls to the contact centre.</li>

              <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>We believe that it's better for an applicant to be told they aren't eligible as quickly as possible
                  - therefore this workflow confirms eligibility and only when that is confirmed, do we check their
                  identity. Does that contradict the current workflow that a CCS agent currently does i.e. do they check
                  identify first then check their eligibility?</li>
                <li>Does the 'one thing per page' pattern for adding a new applicant slow down a CCS agent's ability of
                  checking / adding somebody onto the scheme?</li>
                <li>Does the grouping of information relating to an applicant e.g. Contact details, Relationship details
                  etc... make sense to CSS agents? Would they group things differently? Card sorting exercise to
                  determine this.</li>
                <li>How does the process work when a CCS agent needs to transfer the call to another colleague - or even
                  better - a completely different provider e.g. DWP? How is details of the call shared between them?
